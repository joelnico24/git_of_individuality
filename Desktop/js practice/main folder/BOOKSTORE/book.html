				<div class="panel-body text-center"><p>In this book, a young boy named Nathan Suhoney, who's in 7th grade, goes hiking. While he's climbing, he slips and falls off a cliff that's approximately 400 ft. above ground. He actually doesn't die upon impact. He catches onto a ledge just 16 ft. down the pinnacle of the cliff. It's a foggy morning, so when he falls over the edge, no one can see any farther than 10 ft. down. Since he fell 16 ft., no one can see that he landed on a ledge and didn't die. Read the book to find out what happens next.</p></div>
